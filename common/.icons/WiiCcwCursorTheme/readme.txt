    Wii Cursors v1.0

 ======================

 This cursor set includes 18 hand-crafted (aren't I punny?) Wii-based cursors for your computer. Three of them
 are animated. Several variants are included. I personally prefer using the tilted cursors. These were created due 
 to boredom over the span of a few days. They are FREE, but no selling and claiming as your own. If you like these, 
 spread the word!

 Created and tested on Windows XP.
 All cursors feature (alpha?) semi-transparency, so you won't see unsightly jaggies.


 Wii is (c)opyrighted to Nintendo.

 Comment on the Linux Port:

 This port is far from a complete copy of the Windows version, but it's enough that I think people can
 find use of it.

 I, PurpleMonkeyKing, make no claims of ownership of these cursors. I am merely porting the hard work of
 allewun so as it can be appreciated by the Linux world.

 The source folder contains the pngs I extracted using ImageMagik (and AniTuner for Windows) from the 
 *.cur and *.ani files. The xml files are for use with icon-slicer. I think icon-slicer is able
 to combine more than one cursor per xml file, but I couldn't figure out how to do that.
